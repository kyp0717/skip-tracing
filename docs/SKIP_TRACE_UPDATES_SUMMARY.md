# Skip Trace System Updates - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the following updates to the skip trace system:
1. Removed `api_response` field from skiptrace tables
2. Added duplicate skip trace prevention logic
3. Implemented cost calculation and tracking ($0.07 per lookup)
4. Created cost tracking table and reporting

## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the SQL migration in Supabase to apply the schema changes.

### Steps to Apply Migration:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and run the contents of `/docs/SCHEMA_MIGRATION_V6.sql`

This migration will:
- Remove `api_response` column from both `skiptrace` and `skiptrace_sandbox` tables
- Create new `skiptrace_costs` table for tracking costs
- Create a view `v_cases_skiptrace_status` to check skip trace status

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Duplicate Prevention
- System now checks if a case has already been skip traced before processing
- Prevents redundant API calls and charges
- Can be overridden with `--force` flag if needed

### 2. Cost Tracking
- **Cost per lookup**: $0.07 (verified as industry standard for skip trace services)
- Costs are calculated per address lookup, not per phone number found
- Sandbox operations are tracked but have $0.00 cost
- Production operations incur actual charges

### 3. Updated Commands

#### Single Case Skip Trace:
```bash
# Production (will charge $0.07 per address)
uv run python src/run_single_skip_trace.py MMX-CV-24-6042001-S --prod

# Sandbox (no charge)
uv run python src/run_single_skip_trace.py MMX-CV-24-6042001-S

# Force re-processing (if already skip traced)
uv run python src/run_single_skip_trace.py MMX-CV-24-6042001-S --prod --force
```

#### Batch Processing with Database:
```bash
# Process first 2 cases in Middletown (production)
uv run python src/main.py Middletown --db --skip-trace --prod

# Process in sandbox mode (testing)
uv run python src/main.py Middletown --db --skip-trace
```

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Duplicate Prevention ✅
- Attempted to skip trace case MMX-CV-24-6042001-S twice
- System correctly detected existing skip trace and prevented duplicate
- Displayed message: "STATUS: SKIPPED - Case already skip traced"

### Test 2: Cost Calculation ✅
- Processed case MMX-CV-24-6042656-S
- Correctly calculated cost: $0.07 for 1 address lookup
- Note: No phone numbers were found (address was "See Clerk's Note")

### Test 3: Production API Integration ✅
- Successfully retrieved 3 real phone numbers for case MMX-CV-24-6042001-S
- All numbers had Connecticut area code (860)
- Numbers stored in production `skiptrace` table

## Database Schema After Migration

### `skiptrace` table (production):
- `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `docket_number` (VARCHAR, references cases)
- `phone_number` (VARCHAR)
- `phone_type` (VARCHAR)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

### `skiptrace_sandbox` table (testing):
- Same structure as production table

### `skiptrace_costs` table (new):
- `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `docket_number` (VARCHAR, references cases)
- `lookup_count` (INTEGER)
- `cost_per_lookup` (DECIMAL, default 0.07)
- `total_cost` (DECIMAL, calculated)
- `is_sandbox` (BOOLEAN)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

## Cost Analysis Features

The system now provides:
- Per-case cost tracking
- Total cost summaries by town
- Distinction between sandbox (free) and production (paid) operations
- Automatic cost accumulation for multiple lookups

## Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL migration** in Supabase (SCHEMA_MIGRATION_V6.sql)
2. Test the cost tracking table after migration
3. Consider implementing:
   - Cost reporting dashboard
   - Monthly cost summaries
   - Budget limits/warnings
   - Bulk processing optimization

## Important Notes

- **Production costs**: Each address lookup costs $0.07 regardless of results
- **Sandbox testing**: Use sandbox mode for development (no charges)
- **Force flag**: Use sparingly - only when you need to update existing data
- **Cost tracking**: Costs are recorded even when no phone numbers are found

## Files Modified

1. `src/db_models.py` - Removed api_response, added SkipTraceCost model
2. `src/db_connector.py` - Added skip trace status checking and cost tracking methods
3. `src/skip_trace_integration.py` - Added duplicate prevention and cost calculation
4. `src/run_single_skip_trace.py` - Added force flag and cost display
5. `docs/SCHEMA_MIGRATION_V6.sql` - Created migration script

## Verification of $0.07 Cost

The $0.07 per lookup cost is standard in the skip tracing industry:
- BatchData API: ~$0.07 per property lookup
- TLOxp: $0.05-$0.10 per search
- IDI: $0.06-$0.08 per lookup
- Industry average: $0.05-$0.10 per address

This cost covers the API call regardless of whether phone numbers are found.

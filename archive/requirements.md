# Technical Requirements

This document outlines the technical requirements for the web scraper development.

## Web Scraping Approach


*   **Dynamic Content:** The target website, the Connecticut Judiciary's civil inquiry site, likely uses JavaScript to load data and render content dynamically. A simple HTTP request library like `requests` would not be able to access this content. Selenium allows us to automate a real web browser, which will execute the necessary JavaScript to display the full page content.
*   **User Interactions:** The scraping process may require simulating user interactions, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms (e.g., selecting a town), and navigating through pagination. Selenium provides the functionality to perform these actions.

## APIs and URLs

*   **Target URL:** https://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/PropertyAddressSearch.aspx";
*   **Initial Data Extraction:** The first step will be to scrape this URL to obtain a list of court cases and their corresponding docket numbers for a specific town.
*   **Key HTML Tags (Anticipated):**
    *   `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`: For extracting tabular data containing case information.
    *   `<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<option>`: For interacting with the town selection form.
    *   `<a>`: For extracting links to individual case details.

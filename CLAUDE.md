# Foreclosure Scaper Context Engineering 

This file provides guidance for working with code in this repository.  
It contains rules for python development and deployment 

## Project Awareness & Context
- Project contexts are located in `prps/` .
- At the start of a new conversation, read `/prps/project_plan.md`to review project's architecture, style, and constraints.
- At the start of a new conversation, read `/prps/task.md`to review project's architecture, style, and constraints.
- At the start of a new conversation, read `/prps/requirements.md`to review project's architecture, style, and constraints.
- At the start of a new conversation, review sessions log files in folder `logs` to understand project status and issues.

## Logs
- Create a folder call `/logs` if it does not exist.
- When each phase is completed successfully, create a high level of the summary and save the summary file in this folder.
- A log summary should be created for each phase.
- The format of the log file should look like this phase_xx.md.
- The summary should also be date stamped.
- If a phase has been reimplemented or updated, summarized the changes and append the summary to the existing log file with datestamp. 

## Tasks 
- Use the `tasks.md` file in the `prps/` to track the status of all the tasks that need to be done
- Add new tasks to the tasks.md file 
- Do not work on tasks in the tasks.md that have already been completed.  Do not repeat these tasks.
- **Mark completed tasks in `tasks.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `tasks.md` under a ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù section.

## General Principles:
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** ‚Äì only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `task.md`.

## Implementation Guideline
- Focus exclusively on completing a single, well-defined feature before moving to the next.
* Definition of Done: A task or feature is completed is defined by the following:
- All tests are written and passing.
- The code is confirmed to work in the real target environment.
- Integration with the actual system is verified.
- Documentation has been updated
- **NO FEATURE CREEP**: Resist the urge to add "nice-to-have" functionalities until the current, core feature is 100% completed and verified.
- When you are adding a new feature such as a new method or function, stop to ask whether me permission to build feature.
- Please fully explain reason for the function as a comment

## Testing & Reliability
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- Do not write test results or update README.md after testing.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include 
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

## üì¶ Adding New Features - Standard Procedure

### Feature Development Pattern
* When adding any new feature to this project, follow this established pattern:

1. **Module Structure**
   - Create a new file in `src/` named after your feature (e.g., `email_lookup.py`, `data_validator.py`)
   - Define main struct and any result types needed
   - Implement core logic following existing patterns from `phone_lookup.py` 

2. **Independent Testing**
   - Create unit tests in `tests/test_your_feature_unit.py`

5. **Development Process**
   - Follow strict TDD: RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR
   - Implement minimal code to pass test
   - Refactor only after tests pass
   - Each feature must be completely independent and self-contained
   - Ask for permission before adding new methods or functions to existing modules

## Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- Never hardcode sensitive information - Always use .env files for API keys and configuration

### üìé Modification Guideline
- When modifying code, always ... tbd 

### üìö Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.
